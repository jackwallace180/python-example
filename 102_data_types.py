# Numerical Data types
# - Int, long, float, complex
# These are numerical data types which we can use numerical operators.

# Complex and Long we don't use as much
# Complex bring an imaginary type of number
# long - are integers of unlimited size
#

# int - Stands for integers
# Whole numbers
my_int = 10
print(my_int)
print(type(my_int))

# Opperator - Add, Subtract, devide and multiply
  # Exponential
print(4 + 3)
print(4 - 3)
print(4/2) # Devisions automatically get converted to float
print(4//2) # Keeps it as interger / drops the decimal
print(10/3)
print(5//2)
print(4*2)
print(3**2)

#Modules looks for the number of remainder
# % ##
print(10%3) ## --> 3*3 = 9, so 1 is the remainder
print(22%3) ## --> 3*7 = 21, so 1 is the remainder
print(23%3) ## --> 3*7 = 21, so 2 is the remainder

# Comparission Operators # --> boolean value

#  ==  - Comparission Operator
#  < / >  - Bigger and smaller than
#  <=  - Smaller than or equal
#  >=  - Bigger than or equal
#  !=  - Not equal
# is and is not
