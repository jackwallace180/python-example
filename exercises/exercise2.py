# As a user, I want to be able to guess a number and know if i got it correct or not, so that I can know if I won or not.


# We should define/assign number to a variable called magic_number
magic_number = 7

# I need to ask user for input
magic_input = int(input("Please input your magic number: "))

# I need to check if this input matches a magic_number
print("Your guess was: "+ str( magic_number == magic_input))

print("Your guess was:", magic_number == magic_input)

# I need to let the user know if the response was write or not
